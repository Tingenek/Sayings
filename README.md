# Sayings

This is a small example project using a Jupyter Notebook to retrieve data from a MarkLogic server using REST.

It's based on Jupyter, so you'll need to install Jupyter Notebook - see https://jupyter.org and I've assumed Python 3.5+

You'll also need a MarkLogic instance to deploy the code and data to.

Installation:

Start Jupyter.
Load FirstNoteBook
Run the cells.
