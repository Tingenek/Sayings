# Sayings

This is a small example project using a Jupyter Notebook to retrieve data from a MarkLogic server using REST.

It's based on Jupyter, so you'll need to: 

- Install Python 3.5+ if you don't have it already - I used Anaconda as it includes Jupyter Notebook see https://jupyter.org for the instructions and other options.
- Install and activate the widgets see https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_install.html

You'll also of course need a MarkLogic instance to deploy the code and data to.

Installation:

Start Jupyter.
Load FirstNoteBook
Run the cells.

Further steps: Install the DashBoard Extension https://jupyter-dashboards-layout.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html and create a dashboard. Add pagination buttons and a search bar.
